# `POP-0201` Human Friendly Feed
Blocks and Chains are not easy to work with.

A Feed is a higher level abstraction that helps developers create, read, append, merge and most importantly inspect blocks.

## Essential techniques

### 0x00 `signPair()`
- returns a `public` and `secret` pair.
They are tagged as `pk` and `sk` in this document only.

### 0x01 `Feed(number|block|Array<block>)`
- returns feed with pre allocated with `number` bytes
- returns feed with block
- default input `4096`

### 0x02 `append(*Feed, data, sk)`
- Constructs and signs a block at the tail of the chain.
- Unsets `EOC` of previously last block
- returns new chain height.

### 0x03 `truncate(*Feed, height)`
- Bricks `fmt` byte with `0xff` of all blocks and keys with greater height.
- Sets `EOC` of block at height
- `truncate(0)` empties chain but does not free memory.
- returns new chain height.

### 0x04 `length(*Feed)`
- returns number of blocks in chain.

### 0x05 `blocks(*Feed, start = 0, end)`
- returns an iterator over blocks

### 0x06 `keys(*Feed)`
- returns an iterator over keys

### 0x07 `fork(*Feed)`
- Allocates new feed/memory
- uses `merge()` to copy keys and blocks from self.
- returns a reconstructed copy of self of exact size

Use case: re-compact buffer.

### 0x08 `clone(*Feed)`
- alloc() + memcpy()
- returns carbon copy of self

### 0x09 `slice(*Feed, start, end)`
- returns a new feed
- contain blocks including start index upto end index

### 0x0A `compare(*Feed, other)`
- returns positive number when `other` is ahead
- returns negative number when `other` is behind
- returns zero when in sync
- throws error ChainsDiverged
- throws error ChainsUnrelated

### 0x0B `merge(*Feed, other|block, iterator = false, noverify = false)`
- mutates `self`
- resizes internal buffer if needed
- uses `compare(self, other)`
- performs reverse merge if needed
- does not mutate `other`
- verifies each new block by default
- returns iterator if `iterator` is set
  - iterator provides `block`, `key`, `abort`
  - `abort` let's user abort the merge
- returns merged count if `iterator` is not set.

This function is the heart of working with data contained in blocks.

### 0x0C `inspect(*Feed)`

Prints a sleek ASCII representation of a feed,
best implementation wins.

## 0xFF Nice To Have
- `feed.last` returns block
- `feed.first` returns block
- `block.key` returns hex-string
- `feed.slice(-2)` returns feed containing last two blocks
- `feed.truncate(-3)` removes last three blocks.
- `new Feed(string)` Decodes Base64-url variant
