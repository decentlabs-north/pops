# `POP-0201` Human Friendly Feed
Blocks and Chains are not easy to work with.

A Feed is a higher level abstraction that helps developers create, read, append, merge and most importantly inspect chains of blocks.

## Essential techniques

### 0x00 `signPair()`
- returns a `public` and `secret` pair.
They are tagged as `pk` and `sk` in this document.

### 0x01 `Feed(number | Uint8Array)`
- default input `4096`
- when input
  - number: Allocates `number` bytes for internal buffer
  - Uint8Array: Use provided memory as internal buffer
- returns feed

### 0x02 `append(*Feed, data, sk)`
- Constructs and signs a block at the tail of the chain.
- Unsets `EOC` of previously last block
- returns new chain height.

### 0x03 `truncate(*Feed, height)`
- Bricks `fmt` byte with `0xff` of all blocks and keys with greater height.
- Sets `EOC` of block at height
- `truncate(0)` empties chain but does not free memory.
- returns new chain height.

### 0x04 `length(*Feed)`
- returns number of blocks in chain.

### 0x05 `blocks(*Feed, start = 0, end)`
- returns an iterator over blocks

### 0x06 `keys(*Feed)`
- returns an iterator over keys

### 0x07 `clone(*Feed)`
- alloc() + memcpy()
- returns a carbon copy of self

### 0x08 `slice(*Feed, start, end)`
- allocates new feed/memory
- contain blocks including start index upto end index
- returns a new feed

Use case: re-compact buffer.

### 0x09 `diff(*Feed, other)`
- returns positive number when `other` is ahead
- returns negative number when `other` is behind
- returns zero when in sync
- throws error `diverged` if conflicting blocks encountered.
- throws error `unrelated` when lacks proof of common parent.

### 0x0A `merge(*Feed, other|block, interactive = false)`
- mutates `self`
- resizes internal buffer if needed
- uses `diff(self, other)`
- performs reverse merge if needed
- does not mutate `other`
- produces verified results
This function is the heart of working with data contained in blocks.

### 0x0B `inspect(*Feed)`

Prints a fancy ASCII representation of a feed,
best implementation wins.

## 0xFF Nice to Have

### iterator = interactiveMerge(*Feed, other)
- returns an abortable iterator.
- iterator peeks at `block` before merge
- let's user abort immediately before `block` is merged
- let's user abort after `block` was merged
