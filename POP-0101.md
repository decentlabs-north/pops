# POP-0101: 14bit PoW MEM

A scheme is proposed to generate a tagged key on handheld devices,
in addition to regular anonymous keys.  
Each user generates secrets until they find a keypair
that they like.

The target difficulty is < 10 minutes on a low-end phone in a browser environment.  
The goal is to incentivize the emergence of "calmer" silos
respecting the rule that _data belongs to user_.

This is not meant to generate exclusivity, but a rough form of indexing.

### Components

| 10  | 32+   |
| 11  | 48+   |

## 2bit Gender

| Key | Value      |

## 4-16bit Geohash

This component is scaleable and should not be taken as truth.
Mining it too far will impact anonymity of the entire network,
cause exclusion, borders and general mayhem.
